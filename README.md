# Rust Workshop 0

This repo contains the setup code for our 0th rust workshop. It has two parts:

* `exercises.rs` - this contains a bunch of empty functions and test module that you are to fill in. Every function you implement should have a test. Run `cargo test` to run your tests. See the file for instructions
* `main.rs` - this is where code for the bitcoin miner will go. See the file for instructions.
